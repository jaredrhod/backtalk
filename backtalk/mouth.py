"""The mouth — streaming sentence-chunked TTS, played through one
long-lived output stream.

Default engine: Kokoro, in-process. Local, free, no server, no API key,
~0.2s to first audio once warm. Optional premium engine: ElevenLabs on
YOUR key — read from the system keychain, never from a file (see
_get_elevenlabs_key) — with Kokoro as the automatic fallback: the voice
degrades instead of going mute if the cloud fails.

Sentences are synthesized one at a time and queued for playback, so the
first sentence is audible while later ones are still rendering. Playback
is cancellable mid-word: set the stop event and the speaker goes silent
within one audio block plus the device buffer (~0.15s).

HARD-WON AUDIO LAW #1 — ONE long-lived OutputStream, reused for every
sentence for the life of the process. A fresh stream per sentence gives
an audible onset blip or a beat of dead air on plenty of audio setups
(USB interfaces, Bluetooth, streaming mixers that latch onto each new
stream late). Proven by A/B test; do not "simplify" this away.

HARD-WON AUDIO LAW #2 — buffer ~0.75s of synthesized audio before a
sentence starts playing, so a slower machine never underruns into
slow-motion garble.

    phonemizer copies the espeak shared library into a fresh mkdtemp() for
    every backend it builds, because espeak-ng keeps its state in globals
    and dlopen refuses to load the same file twice (see the comment in
    phonemizer/backend/espeak/api.py). Kokoro builds several backends, so
    one voice line start leaves several of these behind.

    On POSIX that cleanup rides on weakref.finalize and happens promptly.
    On Windows phonemizer can only register it with atexit, and atexit does
    not run when a process is *killed* rather than exited. Anything that
    launches backtalk from a wrapper and stops it by terminating the process
    — a launcher script, a service wrapper, a supervisor — therefore leaks
    every directory it ever created. Sixty had accumulated on the machine
    where this was found; the count grows per backend per start and never
    falls.

    Patching phonemizer in site-packages is not a fix, because an install
    step that runs `uv sync` or `pip install -U` on launch overwrites it.
    Sweeping at our own startup bounds the total at one run's worth instead.

    Safety rests on two things, not on guesswork:
      1. we only touch directories whose sole content is an espeak library;
      2. Windows refuses to delete a DLL that is currently loaded, so a
         concurrently running instance's directory fails the rmtree and is
         left alone. The OS enforces that, we don't have to detect it.
