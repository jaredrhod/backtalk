"""The ears — mic capture with VAD endpointing, transcribed in-process
by faster-whisper. Local, free, no server, no API key.

record_held() is the hold-to-talk capture (the button is the VAD).
Ears.listen_once() is the legacy open-mic mode: blocks until one
complete utterance is heard, then returns its transcript. Endpointing:
an utterance opens after ~120ms of sustained speech, closes after
`silence_ms` of trailing quiet. A `gate` callable can suppress
listening (so the open mic ignores the speakers unless barge-in is on).
